# BasicCalculator

This is a basic calculator with a small user-interface that I worked on and built over the course of a couple of days. This was my first time using QT creator so I learned a lot from the experience. This calculator can multiply, divide, add, subtract, get the square root of a number, and square numbers as well. It keeps a history of all calculations you perform and allows you to hit the 'h' button to view said history. You can also use the 'clear history' button to delete the history.  It also has a clear button for clearing the current calculation. You can also choose not to hit the clear button so you can chain operations. For example if you perform 10*10=100 and would like to add something to your result, you would refrain from hitting the clear button and just continue performing calculations with that number.
